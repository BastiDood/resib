# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
REPORT_GAS=true pnpm hardhat test
pnpm hardhat node
pnpm hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Resib.ts

# Compile the Hardhat artifacts and Typechain types
pnpm compile

# Build as a JavaScript library
pnpm build
```
